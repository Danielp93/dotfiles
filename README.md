# dotfiles

This is a git-bare managed repository of my dotfiles. `bootstrap.sh` is included to get any Ubuntu/WSL up and running with the latest versions of:
* Bitwarden
* TMUX
* Neovim (Aliassed to all default editors and vim)
* ZSH (Currently not in use)

## Usage
```Bash
$ wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danielp93/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh?token=ABNRJ4KBYZ3IAE6AEXQ6WNC6Z755M | . /dev/stdin 
```
